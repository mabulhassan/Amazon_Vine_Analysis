## Project Summary:
The none-vine reviews had a higher percentage of positive reviews 47% wheres the non vine reviews had only 36.2%. The total number of non vine reviews is significantly higher 64,968 compared to the total number of vine reviews that add up to only 222. The difference in count may have contributed to the positive bias and further analysis is needed to support the statment.
